# Preface {-}

This is my notes of the book titled "[Matrix Algebra From A Statistician's Perspective](https://www.amazon.com/Matrix-Algebra-Statisticians-Perspective-Harville-dp-038794978X/dp/038794978X/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1613419633)" by David A. Harville.

Since **Chapter 1**-Mattices and **Chapter 2**-Submatrices and Partitioned Matrices are very simple and basic, I omit both parts.
